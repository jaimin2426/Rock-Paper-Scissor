# Rock-Paper-Scissor
ðŸ”¹ Game Flow

Both players enter a number

Example:

Player 1 â†’ 12345

Player 2 â†’ 67890

Each player chooses a secret bit position (index of a digit)

Python indexes start from 0.

Example:

Player 1 â†’ chooses position 2 â†’ digit at index 2 in 12345 is 3.

Player 2 â†’ chooses position 4 â†’ digit at index 4 in 67890 is 0.

The chosen digit is converted into a move (Rock, Paper, or Scissor)

The digit is taken mod 3 (digit % 3).

Then itâ€™s mapped like this:

Player One: {0:'Rock', 1:'Paper', 2:'Scissor'}
Player Two: {0:'Paper', 1:'Rock', 2:'Scissor'}


In our example:

Player 1 â†’ digit = 3 â†’ 3 % 3 = 0 â†’ "Rock"

Player 2 â†’ digit = 0 â†’ 0 % 3 = 0 â†’ "Paper"

Winner is decided based on Rock-Paper-Scissors rules

Rock beats Scissor

Scissor beats Paper

Paper beats Rock

Same choice = Draw

Game continues until you enter n when asked.
